# Master Thesis: Software Quality Assurance Using AI-Assisted Test Automation

This repository contains the research, design, and implementation work for my **Master’s Thesis**, which focuses on improving **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** by combining **ISO/IEC 25010 quality standards**, **modern test automation using Playwright**, and **Artificial Intelligence techniques**.

The thesis aims to bridge the gap between **academic quality models** and **practical automation frameworks**, while maintaining a strong research-oriented foundation.
